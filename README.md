Wizard101 dance game bot made with wizwalker

**This project is in development.**

## Known Bugs
- Deadlock when choosing track if the player is facing the wrong direction. A sleep is added as a temporary fix.
- Holding a modifier key, no matter what window has focus, will cause moves to fail to send.

## Goals
- ~~Play dance game~~
- ~~Feed pet snacks~~
- Configuration (GUI, file, command line arguments, ...)
- Detect when energy is low and optionally buy elixirs
- Optimize snack usage (for xp or attributes or both?)
- Choosing snacks to use
- Playing different tracks and choosing the best one
- Stop training at desired level
- Hatching
- Better code
